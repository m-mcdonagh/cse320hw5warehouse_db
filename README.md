To compile the Client (Part 2.2.1), call "make client" which will create an out file named "client"
To compile the remote Warehouse Database (Part 2.2.2), call "make warehouse\_db" which will create an out file named "warehouse\_db"
To compile both together, no argument is needed (just call "make"), which will create both "client" and "warehouse\_db" out files
Calling "make clean" deletes both out files
